# Background and Motivation

The user wants to integrate the functionality built in `/dapp` into the `/minikit-app` folder to create a miniapp using the existing dapp features.
The judges suggested that each "coin a post" should have its own unique link/embed and utilize Gen-AI to stylize text, fonts, or background images so posts stand out and drive more engagement.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Understanding the architecture and module boundaries within `/dapp`.
- Identifying shared dependencies and resolving version mismatches between `/dapp` and `/minikit-app`.
- Migrating configuration settings (environment variables, build scripts, bundlers).
- Adapting file paths, imports, and project structure to the new context.
- Ensuring both automated tests and manual QA pass after migration.
- Designing an embed generation system to serve standalone coin post pages.
- Integrating a Gen-AI pipeline to generate custom styling (fonts, colors, backgrounds) for each post.
- Persisting and retrieving styling metadata per coin post.
- Rendering embedded posts responsively in different contexts (timeline, external embeds).

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. Analyze `/dapp` structure and features.
   - Success: Document all modules, components, utilities, and external dependencies.
2. Setup scaffolding in `/minikit-app`.
   - Success: Clean project structure with basic config (package.json, tsconfig, etc.) is in place.
3. Migrate core shared modules.
   - Success: Utility functions and services imported and operational.
4. Migrate UI components.
   - Success: Components render without errors in the miniapp context.
5. Adjust and install dependencies.
   - Success: Running `yarn install` succeeds; no unresolved package issues.
6. Migrate build and script configuration.
   - Success: Build scripts (`yarn build`, `yarn start`) produce working artifacts.
7. Migrate business logic and data layer.
   - Success: API/GraphQL integrations function correctly.
8. Configure environment variables.
   - Success: Environment-specific configs load as expected.
9. Write and migrate tests.
   - Success: Unit and integration tests run and pass in `/minikit-app`.
10. QA and bug fixes.
    - Success: Manual test scenarios all pass without critical issues.
11. Final review and documentation.
    - Success: README updated; architecture and migration documented.
12. Design and implement unique post page and embed URLs.
    - Success: Each coin post generates a standalone route and embed URL that renders only that post.
13. Integrate Gen-AI styling for coin posts.
    - Success: Use a Gen-AI model (e.g., OpenAI) to generate custom CSS styling (fonts, colors, backgrounds) and store the metadata.
14. Update timeline UI to render embed and copy controls for coin posts.
    - Success: Timeline cards apply dynamic styling and provide a button to copy/embed the post.
    - Success: Apply generated custom styling to timeline posts.
    - Success: Restyled `CoinDetails` component with gradient outline, padding, and updated card header/content look

# Lessons

* Encountered engine version mismatch when adding certain packages; Node >=18.18 is required for `@metamask/providers`. Consider upgrading Node or using `--ignore-engines` when installing.*
