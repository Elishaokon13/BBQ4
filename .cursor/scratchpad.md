# Background and Motivation

The user wants to integrate the functionality built in `/dapp` into the `/minikit-app` folder to create a miniapp using the existing dapp features.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Understanding the architecture and module boundaries within `/dapp`.
- Identifying shared dependencies and resolving version mismatches between `/dapp` and `/minikit-app`.
- Migrating configuration settings (environment variables, build scripts, bundlers).
- Adapting file paths, imports, and project structure to the new context.
- Ensuring both automated tests and manual QA pass after migration.

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. Analyze `/dapp` structure and features.
   - Success: Document all modules, components, utilities, and external dependencies.
2. Setup scaffolding in `/minikit-app`.
   - Success: Clean project structure with basic config (package.json, tsconfig, etc.) is in place.
3. Migrate core shared modules.
   - Success: Utility functions and services imported and operational.
4. Migrate UI components.
   - Success: Components render without errors in the miniapp context.
5. Adjust and install dependencies.
   - Success: Running `yarn install` succeeds; no unresolved package issues.
6. Migrate build and script configuration.
   - Success: Build scripts (`yarn build`, `yarn start`) produce working artifacts.
7. Migrate business logic and data layer.
   - Success: API/GraphQL integrations function correctly.
8. Configure environment variables.
   - Success: Environment-specific configs load as expected.
9. Write and migrate tests.
   - Success: Unit and integration tests run and pass in `/minikit-app`.
10. QA and bug fixes.
    - Success: Manual test scenarios all pass without critical issues.
11. Final review and documentation.
    - Success: README updated; architecture and migration documented.

# Project Status Board

- [x] Analyze `/dapp` structure and features
  - **Directories and files in `/dapp/src`**:
    - `wagmi.ts`, `types.ts`, `constants.ts`
    - `components/`, `app/`, `lib/`
  - **Configuration files**:
    - `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `next.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`
  - **External dependencies** (from `package.json`):
    - `@radix-ui/*`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `@zoralabs/coins-sdk`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `mongodb`, `next`, `next-themes`, `openai`, `react`, `react-dom`, `sonner`, `tailwind-merge`, `viem`, `wagmi`
  - **DevDependencies**:
    - `@types/node`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `@wagmi/cli`, `autoprefixer`, `postcss`, `postcss-import`, `postcss-nesting`, `tailwindcss`, `tailwindcss-animate`, `typescript`, `bufferutil`, `encoding`, `lokijs`, `pino-pretty`, `supports-color`, `utf-8-validate`
- [x] Setup scaffolding in `/minikit-app`
  - Verified Next.js 13 miniapp structure: `app` directory present; `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `next.config.mjs`, and `postcss.config.mjs` are configured.
- [x] Migrate core shared modules
  - Migrated database connection utility (`lib/mongodb.ts`).
  - Migrated utility function (`lib/utils.ts`).
  - Migrated Web3/Wagmi config (`lib/wagmi.ts`) and updated `Providers` wrapper.
  - Migrated constants (`lib/constants.ts`).
  - Migrated type definitions (`lib/types.ts`).
- [x] Migrate UI components
  - [x] Migrate UI primitives (copied `components/ui` folder into `/minikit-app/app/components/ui`)
  - [x] Migrate core UI components
    - Updated import paths and integrated core components: CoinButton, IdeaInput, SuccessCard, CoinDetails, WalletConnect, WelcomeScreen, CoinCreationFlow, Header, Logo; added OnChainKit frame logic with plus/check icons, removed text labels; removed duplicate WalletConnect inline fallback and replaced with instruction text.
- [x] Adjust and install dependencies
  - Installed: `lucide-react`, `sonner`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `@zoralabs/coins-sdk`, `mongodb` (used `--ignore-engines`).
- [x] Migrate build and script configuration
  - Merged Next.js settings into `next.config.mjs`: added `transpilePackages`, `experimental.esmExternals`, and `webpack.resolve.fallback` adjustments.
  - Updated `postcss.config.mjs` with `postcss-import`, `tailwindcss/nesting`, `tailwindcss`, and `autoprefixer` plugins.
  - Extended `tailwind.config.ts` to include `darkMode`, updated `content` paths, container settings, theme extensions (fonts, colors, animations, keyframes, background images, shadows).
- [x] Migrate business logic and data layer
  - [x] Copy API route directories from `/dapp/src/app/api` into `/minikit-app/app/api`
  - [x] Updated imports and handlers in route files (coin-metadata import path fixed, OpenAI and mongodb utilities configured)
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Write and migrate tests
- [x] QA and bug fixes
  - [x] Replace 'Warpcast' with 'Farcaster' in WalletConnect error messages
- [ ] Final review and documentation

# Lessons

* Encountered engine version mismatch when adding certain packages; Node >=18.18 is required for `@metamask/providers`. Consider upgrading Node or using `--ignore-engines` when installing.*
