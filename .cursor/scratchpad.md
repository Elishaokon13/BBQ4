# Project Status Board
- [x] Explore project structure and identify technologies.
  - Discoveries:
    - Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript (JSX/TSX)
    - Frameworks: Next.js, React
    - Styling: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS
    - Package managers: Yarn, npm, pnpm (multiple lockfiles present)
    - Major directories: src/, public/, node_modules/, .cursor/
- [x] Review configuration files.
  - Findings:
    - TypeScript config (`tsconfig.json`):
      - target: `es5`, lib includes `dom`, `esnext`; `allowJs` enabled; `strict` mode on; `noEmit` set; path alias `@/* -> src/*`.
      - Overall appropriate for a Next.js TypeScript project.
    - Next.js config (`next.config.js`):
      - transpilePackages: `['@zoralabs/coins-sdk']`.
      - webpack fallback disabling `fs`, `net`, `tls`, `crypto`.
      - experimental `esmExternals: 'loose'`.
      - Bundler settings look correct.
    - Tailwind CSS config (`tailwind.config.js`):
      - `darkMode: 'class'`, content paths: `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/app`.
      - Extended theme colors, borderRadius, animations, background images.
    - PostCSS config (`postcss.config.js`):
      - plugins: `postcss-import`, `postcss-nesting`, `tailwindcss`, `autoprefixer`.
      - Configuration aligns with Tailwind setup.
    - `package.json`:
      - scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint` (`next lint`).
      - No explicit ESLint or Prettier config files detected; relies on Next.js defaults.
      - Consider adding custom lint rules or a Prettier setup.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- Completed review of configuration files; no assistance needed.
- Completed fix for fetch error: swapped PROJECT_URL for dynamic request origin and normalized URL protocol in constants.
- Please run the development server and test POST /api/generate-coin to verify the SSL fetch issue is resolved.
- Completed update of use case references across codebase; please review UI text, API routes, and README to confirm all instances now refer to ideas instead of jokes or bangers.
- Completed Task 1: Reconfigured Tailwind theme with the new light palette and typography.
- Completed persistence fix: coin details now persist across sign-in.
- Please test: login flow and confirm that after signing in, your generated coin details and transaction info are retained and displayed correctly.
